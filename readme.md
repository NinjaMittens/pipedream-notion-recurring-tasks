This workflow adds automatic, hands-off **recurring tasks** to Notion. 

**Need help with this workflow? [Check out the full instructions and FAQ here.](https://thomasjfrank.com/notion-automated-recurring-tasks/)**

Issues and bugs can be reported at this automation's [Github repo](https://github.com/TomFrankly/pipedream-notion-recurring-tasks/issues).

## Compatibility

This workflow **only** works with Notion databases that have my recurring task helper formulas:

* [Ultimate Brain for Notion](https://thomasjfrank.com/brain/) – the **ultimate** second brain template for Notion. A completely productivity system that brings tasks, notes, projects, goals, and useful dashboards into one place. *Use code **LETSGO2024** to get $50 off!*
* [Ultimate Tasks](https://thomasjfrank.com/templates/task-and-project-notion-template/) – my free task manager template, and the best free task manager for Notion.
* * *Ultimate Brain contains an upgraded version of Ultimate Tasks, adding GTD support, better integration with your notes, and useful dashboards (like the My Day dashboard).*
* [Recurring Tasks](https://thomasfrank.notion.site/Advanced-Recurring-Task-Dates-2022-20c62e1f755742e789bc77f0c76aa454?pvs=4) – *this is a barebones template intended for learning purposes.*

## Instructions

* [Duplicate the workflow](https://thomasjfrank.com/pipedream-notion-recurring-tasks/) into your own Pipedream account.
* **Set your timezone** in the Trigger step (Trigger → Configure → Schedule → Timezone).
* Optional: Adjust the schedule in the Trigger step. By default, this workflow will run once per day at 11:57pm. You can make it run more frequently; just keep [Pipedream's credit limits](https://pipedream.com/pricing) if you're on the free plan. This workflow nearly always takes 1 credit per run.
* Generate a test event in the Trigger step, then hit Continue and move onto the notion_recurring_tasks step.
* Connect your Notion account, then choose your Tasks database, Due date property, Task Status property, and any other needed properties.
* Test the workflow.
* Hit **Deploy** to enable the workflow.

**Note:** This automation will automatically change the UTC Offset and Type formula properties in your task database. This helps things run smoothly; you can learn more about why these changes are made [in this reference section](https://thomasjfrank.com/notion-automated-recurring-tasks/#formula-property-changes).
